# How to Get Unbanned on Diablo 4 (2025 Guide) 🔥

Getting banned from Diablo 4 can feel like you’ve hit a Rift Guardian’s trap—super frustrating, especially if you swear you did nothing wrong. Don’t panic! This simple guide will walk you through what to do if you’re banned and how to appeal for the best chance to get your account resurrected and back in the game.

## Maybe You Are HWID Banned? 🖥️

Did you get banned right after making a fresh Diablo 4 account? Or maybe the ban follows you no matter what account you try? It’s possible you’ve been **HWID banned** (Hardware ID Ban)! Diablo 4 might have flagged your PC’s hardware info, which is why your ban keeps haunting you like a pesky demon.

## Step 1: Understand Why You Were Banned ❓

Check your email—and Blizzard’s game notifications—for details on why your Diablo 4 account was banned. Usual suspects include:
- Cheating or using unauthorized third-party software  
- Toxic chat or harassment in PvP or group play  
- Sharing accounts or suspicious account activity  

**Pro tip:** Take a quick peek at the Blizzard Terms of Service before filing your appeal.
